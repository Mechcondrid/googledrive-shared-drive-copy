# googledrive-shared-drive-copy
Google made it nearly impossible to copy a folder structure from mydrive to a shared drive. Problem solved with Google App Script and Google Drive API. 

Getting started with Google App Script https://developers.google.com/apps-script

Just edit the source folder ID and the destination folder ID.

Important note: Enable the Drive service in the script editor https://developers.google.com/apps-script/advanced/drive
